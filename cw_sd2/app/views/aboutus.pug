      p.paragraph
        | TicketSphere is a secure, practical, and equitable marketplace for buying and selling tickets for plays, concerts, festivals & sporting events. We limit our markup from the original sales price to a maximum of 20% in order to safeguard consumers from overpricing. TicketSphere modifies its markup in accordance with country-specific laws and regulations that establish the maximum price at which a product may be resold. As a customer, you are aware that the cost of your tickets will always be reasonable. We do user checks as well as alliances and cooperation with event planners help to prevent fraud.
